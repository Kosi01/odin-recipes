    <h1>Description</h1>
    spaghetti is a thin, straight, cylindrical pasta of Italian origin, the most
    popular of all pastas eaten today. Noodles made of wheat and eggs were known
    in the Mediterranean world in antiquity, but the pasta we know as
    spaghetti—which takes its name from the Italian spaghetto, “little cord”—was
    probably introduced to Sicily by the island's Arab conquerors in the 8th
    century.
